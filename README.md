#🐉 Mythical Creature Caretaker (Java OOP)
📌 Project Overview
Developed as a core academic project for CS Level 06, this Java application simulates a complex management system for maintaining the health and temperament of mythical entities. The program challenges the user to strategically manage resources (food, medicine, and environment) to ensure survival through multiple simulation rounds.

🎯 Key Learning Objectives
Object-Oriented Design: Implementing custom classes (Creature) to encapsulate state and behavior.

Data Structures: Utilizing arrays of objects to manage a dynamic "Creature Record" system.

Algorithm Logic: Developing a "Killer Score" algorithm to calculate survival probability based on weighted environmental factors.

💻 Technical Implementation
Encapsulation: Designed a Creature class with specific attributes including Anger_level, Hunger_level, and Magic_level.

Resource Management Logic: Built a Calculate_Score method to handle real-time stat modification based on user actions (Givefood, Vaccinate, Moveit).

Validation Systems: Implemented robust input validation (CheckValid) to ensure system stability during user interaction.

Procedural Execution: Organized code into modular static methods (Playgame, Print_Data, Danger_Message) for high maintainability.

🛠️ Skills & Tools Used
Language: Java (JDK 8+)

Input Handling: java.util.Scanner for interactive CLI.

Concepts: Arrays of Objects, Conditional Logic, Looping, Static Methods, and Class Instantiation.

🚀 Impact & Results
System Accuracy: Successfully implemented a multi-round game loop that tracks 5 distinct creature types simultaneously.

User Feedback: Integrated a dynamic Danger_Message system that provides tiered feedback based on calculated risk levels (Peaceful, Miffed, Dangerous, Rabid).

Code Quality: Achieved a clean separation of concerns by isolating the data printing logic from the core game mechanics.
